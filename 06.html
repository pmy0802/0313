    <h1>Finding forrest</h1>
    <p>Although the film is not based on a true story, film critics have compared the character portrayed by Connery with real-life writer J. D. Salinger.[3][4] Connery later acknowledged that the inspiration for his role was indeed Salinger.</p>
    <p>Principal photography was shot entirely in Manhattan, the Bronx, and Brooklyn (many Mailor Academy scenes were filmed at Regis High School on the Upper East Side of Manhattan),[6] with some scenery and pick-up shots made in suburban Toronto, Ontario during post-production.[7][8] Parts of the film were also shot in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.</p>
